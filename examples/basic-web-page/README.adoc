## Description

This example demonstrates how to integrate the plug-in into a basic web page.

You need to follow these steps:

1. Download the bundled component code and wrap it inside a `window.load` event listener to ensure React is loaded before the component is initialized.

2. Add React, ReactDOM, optionally Babel and the plug-in to your page as scripts, also link to the component's css file

3. Import the component in a script tag, initialize a React root and render the component on it



```html
<!-- load React -->
<script
    async
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"
></script>
<script
    async
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
></script>
<!-- Add babel to be able to use JSX -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
```

Since it is a React component, React needs to be added. The example also uses Babel to allow the use of JSX, but this is not necessary. You could also replace, for instance,

```jsx
<SpringBootHealthCheck
    // The host of the spring boot application
    springBootAppUrl="http://localhost:8000"
    // The interval in milliseconds for checking the health status
    checkInterval={10000}
    // The HTML class property of the component
    className={"health-check"}
    // Enable to use the default styling, disable and add custom classes for custom styling
    shouldUseDefaultStyling
    // The kind of health check that will be performed
    // Default is "actuator" for regular spring boot actuator health endpoints
    // "admin" is for HTTP Basic password-protected Stardog endpoints
    // "basic" is for a dumb request to the provided URL verifying the response is ok
    type={"basic"}
    />
```

with the following vanilla JavaScript:

```js
React.createElement(SpringBootHealthCheck, {
    springBootAppUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
    checkInterval: 10000,
    className: "health-check",
    shouldUseDefaultStyling: true,
    type: "basic",
})
```
