<SpringBootHealthCheck
  // The host of the spring boot application
  springBootAppUrl="http://localhost:8000"
  // The interval in milliseconds for checking the health status
  checkInterval={10000}
  // The HTML class property of the component
  className={"health-check"}
  // Enable to use the default styling, disable and add custom classes for custom styling
  shouldUseDefaultStyling
  // The kind of health check that will be performed
  // Default is "actuator" for regular spring boot actuator health endpoints
  // "admin" is for HTTP Basic password-protected Stardog endpoints
